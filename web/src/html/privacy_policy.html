                        have collected from you. We may also collect personal information that is necessary for our
                        legitimate interests, which will be disclosed to you at the time of collection. We will use this
                        information for the purposes of which it was collected.&nbsp; We collect information from you,

                        information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able
                        to see it.&nbsp; You may choose not to provide all or a portion of this information, however
                        creating an account is a prerequisite for using the full functions of the Site.&nbsp; </p>

                        store certain types of information from you each time you use the Site or Service. For example

                    <ul data-rte-list="default">
                        <li><p style=""><strong>Cookies.</strong> Cookies are small data files
                            stored on your hard drive by a website. Among other things, cookies help us improve our Site
                            and Service and improve your experience on our Site and within our Service by analyzing the
                            way you use our Site and Service. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but that
                            may prevent us from providing you with the full range of Service we offer. Also, please be
                            aware that if you visit other websites you may be required to accept cookies. The use of
                            cookies placed by third parties on other websites is not covered by this Privacy Policy. We
                            do not have access or control over such cookies.</p></li>

                            opened and acted upon.</p></li>

                            identifier, similar in function to cookies. Incontrast to cookies, which are placed on a
                            hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages.&nbsp;We use Google Tag manager
                            to cache images on your device for faster loading speeds.&nbsp; We also use Google and

                        (behavioral tracking). We do not respond to browser-based “do not track” signals. Some third
                        party sites who push content to our Site may keep track of your browsing activities over time
                        and across different websites when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what

                    <p style=""><em>Social Information</em>:&nbsp; The Site may offer you the
                        ability to share your personal information through a social networking site (e.g., Facebook,
                        Twitter, LinkedIn), using such site’s integrated tools (e.g., Facebook “Like” button, or Twitter
                        “Tweet” button).&nbsp; The use of such integrated tools enables you to share personal
                        information about yourself with other individuals or the public, depending on the settings that
                        you have established with such social networking site.&nbsp; Additionally, by making personal
                        information available on the website, you “opt in” to allow Kinecho to provide such personal
                        information to a social networking site without your further consent.&nbsp; For more information

                        who have designated you as a Linked Connection, and we may provide information to you about your
                        Linked Connections. If you designated any Linked Connections, you should be aware that your and
                        their entire network may be able to see the shared content, and they also may be able to share
                        your information on third party sites and services.&nbsp; You should be aware that your Linked
                        Connections may still have access to the shared content after you terminate your account.&nbsp;
                        You may also name a Linked Connection as a contact, and they may (subject to the payment
                        of fees) have access to your information in the event of your death or disability. &nbsp;You
                        should be aware that contacts have the ability to modify, delete, share, and update your
                        content, and may set different preference settings than you have chosen. </p>

                        the right to data portability. Where any processing of personal information is solely dependent
                        upon your consent, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time (For example, we
                        suggest by using the unsubscribe link contained in an applicable marketing message or emailing

                        search for that information would require disproportionate effort or have a disproportionate
                        effect to, for example, the cost of providing the information, the time it would take to
                        retrieve the data, or how difficult it may be to obtain the information requested.</p>
