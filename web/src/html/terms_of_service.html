                                    party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other party, by
                                    certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Kinecho should
                                    be addressed to: Kinecho Management Team. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature
                                    and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. If
                                    Kinecho and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after
                                    the Notice is received, you or Kinecho may commence an arbitration proceeding
                                    pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for
                                    Consumer Related Disputes (collectively “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration
                                    Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement. A single neutral arbitrator will
                                    be selected by agreement of the parties. If an agreement cannot be reached, a single
                                    neutral arbitrator will be selected according to the AAA’s procedures and the
                                    Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (“FAA”), and the claims will be resolved
                                    pursuant to this Mandatory Dispute Resolution/Class-Arbitration Waiver provision and
                                    the AAA Rules in effect when the claim is filed. The AAA Rules are available online
                                    at www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration and can also be obtained by calling the AAA at
                                    1-800-778-7879. AAA will administer the arbitration, and you may file a demand for
                                    arbitration at www.adr.org. Unless Kinecho and you agree otherwise, any in-person
                                    arbitration hearings will occur within 100 miles of your address, with the
                                    preference that it occur in the county/parish of your address. If a claim is for
                                    $10,000 or less, the party submitting the claim may choose whether the arbitration
                                    will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator
                                    (“desk arbitration”), through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as
                                    established by the AAA Rules. The arbitrator conducting a desk arbitration or
                                    telephonic hearing may be located anywhere in the United States. If a claim exceeds
                                    $10,000, the AAA Rules govern where a hearing occurs. The arbitration will be
                                    confidential, but either party may notify any governmental authority of the claim.

                                    arbitrator, not any court or agency, has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute

                                    of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide
                                    relief warranted by that individual’s claim.</p></li>

                                    administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with
                                    this arbitration provision and (b) will not seek an award of its attorney’s fees. If
                                    the arbitrator finds that the substance of the claim or the relief sought is
                                    frivolous, however, then the AAA Rules will govern the payment of all fees, and
                                    Kinecho may seek an award of its reasonable attorney’s fees. Furthermore, if you
                                    initiate an arbitration seeking more than $75,000 in damages, the AAA Rules govern
                                    the payment of all fees. You are responsible for all additional costs that you incur

                                    witnesses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this provision, Kinecho will
                                    pay all fees and costs that it is required to pay under the law.</p></li>
